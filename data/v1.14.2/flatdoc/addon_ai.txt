head AI
body Lua AI can be run on any character, and their resulting actions are dictated by their state and the AI Type of the seat they are attached to.
body Gun components and Camera components can be linked to a seat by naming them identically. 
body Sets the AI state for a character object.

body Sets the target destination for an AI.
code server.setAITarget(object_id, matrix_destination)

body Sets the target character for an AI. Different AIs use this data for their unique tasks.
code server.setAITargetCharacter(object_id, target_object_id)
body Sets the target vehicle for an AI. Different AIs use this data for their unique tasks.
code server.setAITargetVehicle(object_id, target_vehicle_id)
head AI Teams
body Characters and vehicles can be assigned to teams. Characters with AI enabled can be set to target certain teams, which will allow a character with handheld weapons equipped to automatically shoot at the targeted teams.
body A team is an index between 0(default) and 30.
body Default Teams:
body 0 - Default
body 29 - Prey Creatures
body 28 - Predator Creatures
body 27 - Zombies
body 1 - Used by default scripts for player team
body 2 - Used by default scripts for enemy AI
body Set team value for a character. 0 to 29.
code server.setAICharacterTeam(character_id, team)
body Set team value for a vehicle. 0 to 29.
code server.setAIVehicleTeam(vehicle_id, team)
body Set if a character should target a team. 0 to 29.
code server.setAICharacterTargetTeam(character_id, team, is_target)
