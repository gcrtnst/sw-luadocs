.... 
body Autosaves the game and live-reloads all active scripts and mission locations to allow for live debugging and editing of missions
code ?reload_scripts
body Kicks the associated player from the game.
code ?kick <peer_id>
body Bans the associated player from the game.

body Give a player admin status. Authorize a player to use commands and bypass custom menu lock.
code ?add_admin <peer_id>
body Remove admin status from a player.

body Give a player auth status. Authorize a player to use workbenches.
code ?add_auth <peer_id>
body Remove auth status from a player.

body Dedicated server only, lets you force the dedicated server to save. save_name parameter is optional and default uses save_name from server config (If config setting is left blank it will save to autosave_server.)
code ?save <save_name>
head Lua scripting overview
body Lua scripting gives you the tools to create advanced missions and custom gamemodes. Stormworks provides a number of functions that allow your script to interface with the game.
.... This guide outlines the functions that are available but is not a comprehensive tutorial on using the Lua language
.... 
.... 
head API General Info
body peer_id can be found on the left side of the player list, singleplayer games always use peer_id 0
body The coordinate system uses Y as the vertical axis for matrices and vectors in world space
body The functionalities of arguments in CAPS are detailed below the corresponding function
body peer_id can be passed as -1 to send for all connected peers
body Any variables saved to a lua table named g_savedata will be saved out and loaded from a per-save lua_data.xml, you can use this to make your scripts persistent
body For code that you want to run once at the start of the save use onCreate(is_world_create) and check is_world_create is true
body Using server.announce() in onCreate will usually cause the messages to be sent before your client is connected and they will not be received
body Remember to avoid the table length operator # and iPairs unless dealing with contiguous tables that start at index 1 (If a table is unexpectedly showing as length 0 this probably means it is not contiguous, the following function can be used for non - standard tables)
code 
.... function tableLength(T)
.... 	local count = 0
.... 	for _ in pairs(T) do count = count + 1 end
.... 	return count
.... end
.... 
head LUA FUNCTIONS
body The following global lua functions are available:
.... 
.... - pairs
.... - ipairs
.... - next
.... - tostring
.... - tonumber
.... 
.... and additional functions are available through the following lua libraries:
.... 
.... - math
.... - table

.... For full documentation of the functions provided by these libraries, visit https://www.lua.org/manual/.
head META FROM THE DEVS
body This scripting API is very powerful and as such there are some important reminders to take note of:
.... 
.... - Your script has a max execution time of 1000 milliseconds, however it is still possible to create scripts that significantly slow down the game. It is your responsibility to ensure your script runs efficiently.
.... 
.... - peer_id can be passed as -1 to send for all connected peers
.... 
.... - Any variables saved to a lua table named g_savedata will be saved out and loaded from a per-save lua_data.xml, you can use this to make your scripts persistent
.... 
.... - A number of safeguards are in place to sandbox your script, however it is still possible to write scripts that will potentially crash your game. If you crash your game with a script, it's likely that you're doing something (very) wrong. This is your own responsibility. If you suspect you have encountered a legitimate bug, please report it on the Stormworks issue tracker (accessible from the pause-menu).
.... 
.... - Malicious and harmful scripts will not be tolerated on the Stormworks Steam Workshop.
.... 
.... Finally, enjoy the almost limitless possibilities that these scripts provide. This short wiki aims to give a good overview of how scripting in Stormworks works, however if you have any questions that are not covered here, please feel free to join us on Discord (accessible from the pause-menu)!
